TRIE - tree like data structure used to store ad search strings efficiently
 - is a special type of N-ary tree used to store strings such 
 - each node represents a character of strings
 - each path from a root to a node represents a prefix


 USE:

 - fast prefix search
 - efficient word insertion and lookup  in dictionaries
 - auto complete
 - spell check ( finding all words starting with that prefix)



real world usecases:

- auto complete system
- spell checking
- IP routing  (longest prefix match)
- word game
- predictive text typing


limitation :

- use more memory
- not efficient if most strings don't share prefixes
